# *Face Recognition and Emotion Predictor using KNeighborsClassifier - scikit-learn*


**Description:**
This project implements a facial recognition and emotion prediction system using the KNeighborsClassifier algorithm. The system is designed with a graphical user interface (GUI) using CustomTkinter for easy interaction. Users can train the model using various faces, and the system will recognize the faces and predict the associated emotions.

**Features:**
- Face recognition: Detects and identifies faces in uploaded images.
- Emotion prediction: Predicts the emotions expressed by the detected faces.
- CustomTkinter GUI: Provides an intuitive interface for users to interact with the system.
- KNeighborsClassifier: Utilizes the KNeighborsClassifier algorithm for facial recognition and emotion prediction.

**Installation:**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/akhil838/FREP_scikit-learn.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd FREP_scikit-learn
   ```
3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

**Usage:**
1. Run the main script:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```
2. Use the add_faces to train the machine to recognise a new face.
3. View the recognized faces and predicted emotions.
